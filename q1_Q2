Q1 — Detailed Guessestimate (Full Marks Version)
Problem:

Estimate the Total Number of E-Scooter Rides Per Week in a city with population 5 million, using a structured Guesstimate Approach.

✅ Step 1: Define the Objective

We need to estimate:

Total E-Scooter Rides per Week = (Number of Active Users) × (Rides per User per Week)
or
Total Rides per Week = Fleet Supply Capacity × Utilization

We will estimate using Demand-side and Supply-side approaches and take the final average.

✅ Step 2: Break Down the Problem ("Top–Down Demand Approach")
2.1 Population Breakdown

Total population = 5,000,000

Usually, 60% are in the age group (18–50 yrs) → target users
→ 5M × 0.60 = 3,000,000 potential adults

2.2 Percentage who use micro-mobility apps

Typical adoption rate: 10%–20%

We take 15%

→ 3,000,000 × 15% = 450,000 potential users

2.3 Realistic Active Weekly Users

Only some of them ride regularly:

Industry standard: 35%–45%
We take 40%

→ 450,000 × 40% = 180,000 active weekly users

2.4 Average rides per active user per week

Based on Lime, Bird, Yulu, Bounce:

Office commuters: 4–5 rides/week

Students: 1–2 rides/week

Mixed average: 3 rides/week

→ Total rides/week = 180,000 × 3
= 540,000 rides per week (Demand Approach)

✅ Step 3: Supply-Side Estimation

Here, we estimate based on available scooters and their utilization.

3.1 Fleet Size

Assume:

The city launches with 10,000 scooters

3.2 Rides per scooter per day

Typical city data:

Lime: 6–8 rides/day

Yulu: 5–7 rides/day

We take: 7 rides/day

3.3 Rides per scooter per week

= 7 rides/day × 7 = 49 rides per week

3.4 Total fleet rides per week

= 10,000 scooters × 49
= 490,000 rides per week (Supply Approach)

✅ Step 4: Validate & Cross-Check

Demand says → 540,000 rides/week
Supply says → 490,000 rides/week

Both are close → indicates good estimation.

⭐ Final Estimate (Average):

= (540,000 + 490,000) ÷ 2
= 515,000 rides per week

⭐ 📌 Final Answer for Exam:

The E-Scooter Rental service can expect approximately 5.0 to 5.2 lakh rides per week in a metropolitan city of 5 million population.

⭐ Q2 — EXTREMELY DETAILED (Full 16 Marks Answer)

Your company is facing slow data ingestion, causing delays in customer onboarding. You need to explain the 5 key components of a Bottleneck Analysis & Resolution Framework.

PART 1️⃣ — Identifying a Bottleneck & Quantifying Impact
(A) What is a bottleneck?

A bottleneck is the slowest step in a pipeline which limits the performance of the entire system.

In data ingestion, it means:

Data is arriving slower than expected

Downstream systems (ETL, training, dashboards) are delayed

Customer onboarding becomes slow

(B) Step 1 — Detecting the Bottleneck

Use Monitoring Tools:

Kafka/Flink lag metrics

API latency

Task execution time

Storage write speed

System resource usage (CPU, network, RAM)

Identify WHERE the slowdown happens:

API call speed?

File upload?

Database writes?

Transformation logic?

Compression/uncompression?

(C) Step 2 — Quantifying Impact
Use KPIs to measure:

Throughput → records/second

Latency → time taken to ingest dataset

End-to-end pipeline delay

Data loss / retry count

Onboarding time increase (direct business impact)

Example:

Earlier → 10 min onboarding

Now → 25 min onboarding
→ 150% increase
→ directly leads to customer dissatisfaction

Difference Between Slow Data Ingestion vs Model Training Bottleneck
Factor	Slow Data Ingestion	Model Training Bottleneck
Pipeline stage	ETL/Data ingestion layer	ML training pipeline
Symptoms	High lag, slow data availability	Long epoch time, GPU overuse
KPIs	latency, throughput, lag	training time, accuracy, GPU load
Business impact	stale data → poor decisions	slow model updates
PART 2️⃣ — Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Purpose:

RCA helps identify the actual underlying cause instead of fixing surface symptoms.

Common RCA Tools:

5 Whys Analysis

Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram

Pareto Chart (80/20 rule)

Log analysis

Infrastructure Monitoring

Example RCA using Ishikawa Diagram

Categories:

Hardware: low bandwidth, old servers

Software: inefficient code, slow transforms

Process: sequential processing

Data: too large files, uncompressed files

People: poor configuration

Environment: network congestion

PART 3️⃣ — Solutions After Identifying Root Cause

After RCA, apply appropriate solutions.

Solution Type 1: Scaling Improvements

Auto-scaling ingestion servers

Horizontal scaling (more instances)

Vertical scaling (bigger CPU/RAM)

Using cloud-managed services like AWS Kinesis, GCP Pub/Sub

Solution Type 2: Pipeline Optimization

Change architecture: Batch → Micro-batch

Use streaming frameworks (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming)

Parallel processing instead of sequential

Compress data before sending

Use faster file formats: Parquet, ORC

Solution Type 3: Database Improvements

Indexing

Bulk writes instead of row-based inserts

Increasing database write throughput

Solution Type 4: Network Improvements

Increase bandwidth

Reduce hops

Use CDN or edge nodes

PART 4️⃣ — Decision Framework (Impact, Cost, Risk)

To choose best solution:
Rate each solution (1–5) on:

1. Impact

How much it increases ingestion speed

If bottleneck is reduced by >50% = High Impact

2. Cost

Cloud resources

Developer hours

Licensing cost

3. Risk

Migration downtime

Data loss risk

Deployment complexity

Choose the solution with highest impact, lowest cost, lowest risk.

PART 5️⃣ — Exploit & Elevate (Final Stage)
Exploit (Quick Wins)

Easy fixes

Low cost

Immediate benefit
Example:

Increase server CPU

Optimize code

Enable batching

Elevate (Long-term Strategic Improvements)

Architectural redesign

Moving from monolithic to distributed ingestion

Adopting Kafka/Flink

Building real-time pipelines

These changes elevate the system to a new performance level.
